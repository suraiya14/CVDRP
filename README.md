# CVDRP (Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction)

## 🚀 Overview
CVDRP implements multiple machine learning and feature selection techniques for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.  
The goal is to evaluate and compare feature selection methods—such as cross-validation-based feature evaluation (CVFE) and Hypergraph Feature Evaluation (HFE)—and build interpretable, high-performing predictive models.
