# CVDRP — Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction

CVDRP is a reproducible pipeline for building and evaluating machine-learning models to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk from clinical and demographic features.

> Repo: https://github.com/suraiya14/CVDRP

## Highlights
- End-to-end data workflow: load → clean → split → train → explain.
- Baseline models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Model explainability (e.g., SHAP) and metric reporting (AUROC, AUPRC, F1).
- Lightweight CLI tool `readfile.py` to quickly **peek** any dataset (CSV/TSV/Excel/JSON) with schema and missing-value summary.
